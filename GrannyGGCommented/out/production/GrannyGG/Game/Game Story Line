<Granny Guga Story Line>

The game starts in a monday.
Guga is going to academia de codigo Oporto, and he is not happy, since the week just started.
When he gets there the door is closed, but the codeCadets are already chasing after him!
Fact is, they want their doubts enlightened, and problems solved. But there are so many! Guga has to run!
Run Guga! RUN!

In this, as we play as Guga, we will "eat" jokes/comedians, kite doubts, run away from codeCadets
obstacles.

Every level passed, Guga's humor will go up, since friday its codeBreak day! Who wouldn't be happy for that??
